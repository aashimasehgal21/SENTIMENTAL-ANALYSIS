# SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS
This Sentiment Analysis project uses the IMDb movie reviews dataset to classify user reviews as positive or negative. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, followed by TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features. A Logistic Regression model is trained on this data to predict the sentiment of new reviews. The project is implemented in Python using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK, and includes model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for performance analysis. It also features a custom prediction function for real-time sentiment (classification)
